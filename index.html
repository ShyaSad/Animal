        <p>Penguins (order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae) are a group of aquatic flightless birds. They live
            almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the Galápagos penguin, found north of
            the equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, and
            their wings have evolved into flippers. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life
            which they catch while swimming underwater. They spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other
            half in the sea.</p>

            Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold
            climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are
            found in the temperate zone, but one species, the Galápagos penguin, lives near the equator.

            The largest living species is the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri):[1] on average, adults are about
            1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb). The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin
            (Eudyptula minor), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 40 cm (16 in) tall and weighs 1 kg
            (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins, larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are
            generally found in temperate or even tropical climates (see also Bergmann's rule). Some prehistoric species
            attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human. These were not restricted to
            Antarctic regions; on the contrary, subantarctic regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant
            penguin occurred in a region around 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya, in a climate decidedly warmer than
            today.
